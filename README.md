#  🤨😹🍉   Hello World  👓💻🌎

Please visit: http://jaspershan.ca/

My name is Yifan Jonathan Dai and I am a fullstack developer with an interest in Cloud Computing and Deep Learning

It seems you have stumbled upon my github repo, here is where I will primarily share any notes about technology that I have written primarily  as a reference for myself that I can access anywhere. However if any knowledge documented here is of interest feel free to use.

The current setup of http://yifandai.ca/ is inspired by @kevintpeng who has a similar setup, which I forked and host on github pages.

Anyways thanks for stopping by.
