<h2 id="ssl-certificate">SSL Certificate</h2>
<p>When we do online shopping, we want to make sure its HTTPS (padlock icon in address bar)</p>
<p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, a protocol used between a browser and a web server</p>
<ul>
<li>The "S" at the end of HTTPS stands for secure</li>
<li>HTTP over Secure Socket Later (Secure socket layer)</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTPS means all communication between your browser and the web server are encrypted.<br>
Behind HTTPs, SSL certificate plays an important role in building trust between a browser and webserver</p>
<p>By definition, a SSL certificate is a web server's digital certificate</p>
<ul><li>Issued by a third party, verified identity of a web server and its public key</li></ul>
<h2 id="sample-flow">Sample flow</h2>
<ol>
<li>My browser requests secure pages (HTTPS) from a yahoo web server</li>
<li>Yahoo server sends its public key with its SSL certificate which is digitally signed by a third party, or we call Certificate Authority, or simply (CA)</li>
<li>Once browser gets certificate, it well check issuers digital signature to make sure the certificate is valid.<br>
* The digital signature is created by a CA's private key and a CA's public key (which is preinstalled on most browsers)<br>
* Thus digital signature is verified, once the certificate's signature is verified, the digital certificate can be trusted<br>
* Green padlock icon appears is shown, it signifies that the web servers public key really belongs to the webserver</li>
<li>Exchanges secret, browser creates two copies of a symmetric key (shared secret). It keeps one and gives a copy to the server (which is encrypted by web servers public key)</li>
<li>When the web server gets the encrypted symmetric key, it uses private key to decrypted and gets the browsers shared key<br>
* From now on both ends with use that key</li>
</ol>
