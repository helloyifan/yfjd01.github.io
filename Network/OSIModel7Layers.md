OSI Model:

### physical layer
* how devices talk to and listen to mediums like wires
* physical structure
* Coax, Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters

### data link layer
* What devices say and listen for to talk to devices connected to them through a medium
* Frames
* Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge

### network layer
* What devices say and listen for to talk to devices connected to them through other devices
* Packets,
* IP, ICMP, IPSecs, IGMP

### transport layer
* what devices say and listen for to maintain conversations with other devices
* End-to-end connections
* TCP, UDP

### session layer / presentation layer / application layer
(these bleed into each other, think of them as one layer)
what devices are actually interested in saying to each other

#### session layer:
* Synch and send to port
* API's, Sockets, WinSock

#### presentation layer:
* Syntax layer
* SSL, SSH, IMAP, FTP, JPEG

#### application layer:
* End User Layer
* HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS
