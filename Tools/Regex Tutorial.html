<ul>
<li>
<strong>a, X, 9,</strong> &lt; -- ordinary characters just match themselves exactly. The meta-characters which do not match themselves because they have special meanings are: <code>. ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \ | ( )</code> (details below)</li>
<li>
<strong>.</strong> (a period) -- matches any single character except newline '\n'</li>
<li>
<strong>\w</strong> -- (lowercase w) matches a "word" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Note that although "word" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word. \W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.</li>
<li>
<strong>\b</strong> -- boundary between word and non-word</li>
<li>
<strong>\s</strong> -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \n\r\t\f]. \S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.</li>
<li>
<strong>\t, \n, \r</strong> -- tab, newline, return</li>
<li>
<strong>\d</strong> -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support but \d, but they all support \w and \s)</li>
<li>
<strong>^ = start, $ = end</strong> -- match the start or end of the string</li>
<li>** \ ** -- inhibit the "specialness" of a character. So, for example, use . to match a period or \ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \@, to make sure it is treated just as a character.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="escape-sequences">Escape sequences</h3>
<p>There are some special characters starting with backslash \ which are known as the escape or control sequences. They do not have corresponding symbols and cannot be found on a keyboard. To represent such characters we use a pair of regular symbols. In a program, this pair will be considered as exactly one character with the appropriate code.</p>
<ul>
<li>'\n' is the newline character;</li>
<li>'\t' is the tab character;</li>
<li>'\r' is the carriage return character;</li>
<li>'\' is the backslash character itself;</li>
<li>'\'' is the single quote mark;</li>
<li>'"' is the double quote mark.</li>
</ul>
