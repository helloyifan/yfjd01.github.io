<h2 id="rest-paradigm">REST paradigm</h2>
<h3 id="representational-state-transfer">REpresentational State Transfer</h3>
<p>REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web</p>
<p>RESTful systems are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server</p>
<h3 id="statelessness">Statelessness</h3>
<p>Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa.</p>
<p>(no concept of previous message)</p>
<h3 id="communication-between-client-and-server">Communication between Client and Server</h3>
<p>In the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses to these requests.</p>
<h3 id="http-verbs">HTTP Verbs</h3>
<p>There are 4 basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system:</p>
<p>GET — retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources<br>
POST — create a new resource<br>
PUT — update a specific resource (by id)<br>
DELETE — remove a specific resource by id</p>
<h3 id="well-whats-crud-then">well whats CRUD then</h3>
<p>CRUD is an acronym for:</p>
<p>CREATE procedures generate new records via INSERT statements.<br>
READ procedures reads the data based on input parameters. Similarly, RETRIEVE procedures grab records based on input parameters.<br>
UPDATE procedures modify records without overwriting them.<br>
DELETE procedures delete where specified.</p>
<p>CRUD’s origins are in database records. By definition, CRUD is more of a cycle than an architectural system. On any dynamic website, there are likely multiple CRUD cycles that exist.</p>
<p>REST is a robust API architecture.<br>
CRUD is a cycle for keeping records current and permanent.</p>
<p>CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture</p>
