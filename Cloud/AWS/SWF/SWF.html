<h2 id="what-is-swf">What is SWF?</h2>
<p>Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) is a webservices that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components. SWF enables applications for a range of use cases, including media processing, web application backends, business process workflows and analytics pipelines, to be designed as a coordination of tasks.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>Tasks represent invocations of various processing steps in an application which can be performed by executable code, web services calls, human actions, and scripts</p>
<ul>
<li>SWF is a way of coordinating both applications and with human beings (manual processing)</li>
<li>Human element is involved</li>
<li>SWF is a way of combining digital interations and human tasks</li>
<li>Haha his example is in a warehouse.</li>
<li>SWF has a human element to it as compared to a SQS. (Manual action needed)</li>
<li>Amazon SWF is task-oriented API whereas Amazon SQS offers a message-oriented API</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exam-tips">Exam Tips</h2>
<p>SWF vs SQS</p>
<ul>
<li>SQS has a rentention period of up to 14 days; with SWF, workflow executions can last up to 1 year.</li>
<li>Amazon SWF is task-oriented API whereas Amazon SQS offers a message-oriented API</li>
<li>Amazon SWF ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. With Amazon SQS, you need to handle duplicated message sand may also need to ensure that a messag eis processed only once.</li>
<li>Amazon SWF keeps task of all the tasks and events in an application. With Amazon SQS, you need to implement your own application-level tracking, especially if your application uses multiple queues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="swf-actors">SWF Actors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Workflow Starters - An application that can initate (start ) a workflow. Could be your e-commerce website following the placement of an order or app searching for bus times</li>
<li>Decides - Control the flow of activity tasks in a workflow execution. If something has finished (or failed) in a workflow, a Decider decides what to do next.</li>
<li>Activity Workers- Carry out the activity tasks</li>
