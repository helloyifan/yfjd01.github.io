<h2 id="s3">S3</h2>
<p>S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use with a simple web services interfaces to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.</p>
<p>So what is S3?</p>
<ul>
<li>S3 is a safe place to store your files.</li>
<li>It is Object-based storage.</li>
<li>Spread through multiple devices and multiple facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basics of S3 are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>S3 is <strong>Object-based</strong> - i.e. allows you to upload files.</li>
<li>Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.</li>
<li>There is unlimited storage.</li>
<li><p>Files are stored in Buckets (basically folders)</p></li>
<li>
<strong>S3 is a universal namespace</strong> That is names must be unique globally.<ul>
<li>Thus will have its own web address</li>
<li><a href="https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru" class="uri">https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru</a></li>
<li>two buckets cannot have the same address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When you upload a files to S3, you will receive a <strong>HTTP 200 Code</strong> if the upload has been successful</p></li>
<li><p>S3 is objected based. <strong>Think of Objects just as files.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Objects consist of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Key (This is simply the name of the object)</li>
<li>Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes).</li>
<li>Version ID (Important for versioning)<ul><li>Does version control ( go to previous version)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Metadata (Data about the data you are storing)</li>
<li>Sub-resources<ul>
<li>Access Control Lists</li>
<li>Torrent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does data consistency work for S3?</p>
<ul>
<li>Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects</li>
<li>Eventual consistency for overwrite Puts and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Other Words;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you write a <strong>NEW</strong> file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data.</li>
<li>If you update an "EXISTING file** or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version. Basically changes to objects and take a little bit of time to propagate.</li>
</ul>
<p>S3 has the following guarantees from Amazon;</p>
<ul>
<li>Build for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.</li>
<li>Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability.</li>
<li>Amazon guarantees 11x98s durability of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>S3 has the following features;</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiered Storage Available</li>
<li>Lifecycle Management</li>
<li>Versioning</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>MFA Delete (Multi Factor Authentication)</li>
<li>Secure your data using <strong>Access Control Lists</strong> and <strong>Bucket Policies</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="storage-classes">Storage classes</h2>
<ol><li>S3 Standard</li></ol>
<p>99.99% availability<br>
11x9 durability,<br>
stored redundantly accoess multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designer to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed):<br>
For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower free than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee</p></li>
<li><p>S3 One Zone - IA<br>
For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently access data,<br>
but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience.</p></li>
<li><p>S3 - Intelligent Tiering<br>
Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead</p></li>
<li><p>S3 Glacier<br>
S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost stoarge class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitve with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retreival times configurable from minutes to hours.</p></li>
<li><p>S3 Glacier Deep Archieve<br>
S3 Glacier Deep ARchieve is Amazon S3's lowest-cost stoage class where a retrieval time fo 12hours is acceptable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You are charged for S3 in the following ways;</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Requests</li>
<li>Storage Management Pricing</li>
<li>Data Transfer Pricing</li>
<li>Transfer Acceleration</li>
<li>Cross Region Replication</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cross-region-replication">Cross Region Replication</h2>
<ul><li>Something you can turn on thats for copying data over multiple regions</li></ul>
<h2 id="transfer-acceleration">Transfer Acceleration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.</li>
<li>Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is route to Amazon S3 over an optimizied network path.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exam-tips">Exam Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remember that S3 is <strong>Object-based:</strong> i.e. allows you to upload files.</li>
<li>Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB.</li>
<li>There is unlimited storage.</li>
<li>
<strong>S3 is a universal namespace.</strong> That is, names must be unique globally.</li>
<li>Not suitable to install an operation system on.</li>
<li>Successful uploads will generate a <strong>HTTP 200</strong> statuscode.</li>
<li>You can turn on <strong>MFA Delete</strong> (Protect your objects)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Key Fundamentals of S3 Are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Key (This is simply the name of the object)</li>
<li>Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes).</li>
<li>Verion ID (Important for versioning)</li>
<li>Metadata (Data about data you are storing)</li>
<li>Subresources;<ul>
<li>Access Control Lists (Permissions of that object)</li>
<li>Torrent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.</li>
<li>Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)</li>
</ul>
